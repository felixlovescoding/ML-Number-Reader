# Instructions

To run the project:
  1. Make sure you have all the required libraries for python installed (i.e. Pytorch, Numpy, Matlibplot, Tensorflow, CV2, Keras)
  2. Download and import the **Number_Reader.py** file into your IDE (i.e. Pycharm)
  3. Download the import the number images from the **Digits** folder (**MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE FILE PATHWAY IN YOUR "Number_Reader.py" file** OTHERWISE THE PROGRAM WON"T EXECUTE!!!)
  4. Enjoy!!
  5. The Number_Reader_Model is just attached for the sake of reference


To add your own image samples:
  1. Use any drawing tool that can draw in pixels (i.e. Paint, Photoshop, Pixlr)
  2. Resize the canvas (**DO NOT EXCEED (28 by 28)**)
  3. Use a pencil to draw any number from 1 to 9 (I haven't tested higher numbers)
  4. Save the image as "digit#"  (# refers to the number of your choice)
  5. Make sure to match the file path in **Number_Reader.py**
  6. Enjoy!!
